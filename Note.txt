To the Seeker of the Artifact,
You tread dangerous waters, bounty hunter, chasing a prize that has claimed the lives of many before you.
Your pursuit has not gone unnoticed. You seek the artifact of legends, but do you know what it truly is? Or have you fallen prey to the stories whispered in dimly lit taverns?
Long ago, the artifact was no mere trinket but a key—a tether to powers beyond mortal comprehension. 
It was forged in secrecy, not by human hands but by those who walk unseen in the dark folds of the world.
In its creation, the first bond was made between what lies above and what slumbers below. 
Those who held it were granted dominion, but at great cost. 
Kingdoms rose and fell, each undone by the curse that trails the artifact like a shadow.
It was not stolen, nor lost, as the tales claim. It was hidden. 
Those who buried it atop the Summit of the Dark-Back Mountain did so not to preserve its power but to bury its curse. 
That mountain, cloaked in eternal mist, has become a graveyard of the unworthy—those like you, who sought to grasp what they could not control.
Understand this: the artifact is no mere relic. It is a question. A choice. And a weapon. One does not claim it without being claimed in return. 
Don't expect yourself to be the only one in search of this artifact. That's what makes it a prize- Everyone wants it.
Should you obtain it, you will face the truth of why it was abandoned, and why its bearer has always walked alone.
Turn back, if you value what little life you have left. But if your ambition blinds you to wisdom, then go. 
The artifact awaits. So too does the reckoning.
- One who knows its price
