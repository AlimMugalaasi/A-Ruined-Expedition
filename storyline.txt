In a remote, lawless island once ruled by an ancient civilization, a research team searching for the ruins of a legendary artifact has gone missing. You, A bounty hunter, are hired to locate them—but you quickly discover the situation is far more perilous than expected. The ruins are divided into 4 Areas, each divided into 4 zones, each guarded by other treasure hunters seeking to claim the artifact’s power for themselves. 

After a long while of you serching to no avail, the research team think you took too long and considered you a lost cause. You didn’t know this. You also didn’t know that they hired another even more skilled bounty hunter to collect the artifact, and to kill you too as they believe you betrayed them.

The new bounty hunter is always only a few zones behind you, and he is very, very fast. In every area he passes, he is sure to tell the civilians of your supposedly malicious behavior, making you a wanted man with every area the skilled bounty hunter passes through. You therfore cannot return to an area he has passed through as you realise you are now being tracked down.

At this point, you’re better of just getting the artifact for yourself…
