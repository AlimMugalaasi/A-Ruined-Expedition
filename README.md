# Hunter's Gauntlet
A fun text-based pythion game made as part of a school coding project.

## Storyline:
In a lawless archipelago ruled by rival clans of smugglers and mercenaries, you are a bounty hunter competing to claim a legendary prize: control over the entire region. To win, you must take down the most dangerous bosses in each area while avoiding a relentless assassin hired to eliminate the competition. Spend too long in one area, and the assassin catches up, leading to a deadly game of cat and mouse.
